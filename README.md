# FizzBuzz

## What is this project?

FizzBuzz is a famous coding interview question that eliminates a ton of candidates
right off the bat, so it will be good for you to experience writing this. It’s an extremely simple program,
but you’d be surprised at how many computer science students make it through four years of school
without being able to solve it.
This program prints out every number between 1 and 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, it
prints out Fizz instead of the number. If the number is divisible by 5, it prints out Buzz instead of the
number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints out FizzBuzz instead of the number.
